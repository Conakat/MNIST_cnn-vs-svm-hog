# MNIST_cnn-vs-svm-hog
Comparative study of CNN and SVM (HOG features) for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset using MATLAB

This repository presents a comparative study of different machine learning
and deep learning approaches for handwritten digit recognition using the
MNIST dataset.

The project focuses on the classification of grayscale 28×28 handwritten
digit images by comparing:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained directly on raw image data
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
  feature representations

All models are implemented and evaluated in MATLAB, with emphasis on
methodological comparison between feature-based and end-to-end learning
approaches.
